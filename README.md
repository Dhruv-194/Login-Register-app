# Login-Register-app
This is a Login and Register app which uses Firebase authentication for registering new users and then logging them by properly authenticating. Moreover the new registered users are also an authentication email which they need to confirm before successfully signing in. The data of the users are stored to the Firebase database which is then retrieved in the profile section. 

This basic login-sign up app can be integrated anywhere in any app for authentication and management of users.
