# Login-Register-app
This is a Login and Register app which uses Firebase authentication for registering new users and then logging them by properly authenticating. Moreover the new registered users are also an authentication email which they need to confirm before successfully signing in. The data of the users are stored to the Firebase database which is then retrieved in the profile section. 

This basic login-sign up app can be integrated anywhere in any app for authentication and management of users.

## How to run the app? 
> - This app needs you to Register first and then login. 
> - In the register activity you need to attach a profile photo, add a valid email address, enter a password with 8 or more characters. 
> - You need to enter a valid email address because an email is sent to the user to verify himself/herself before finally logging into the app.  
> - Then you can enter your above used credentials to login into the app. 
> - The app also has a logout button to logout from the app.
